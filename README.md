## 🌍 Overview

WildGuard is a revolutionary conservation platform that transforms ordinary mobile phones into a powerful wildlife protection network across Africa. By leveraging SMS, USSD, Voice calls, and IoT sensors, we create a comprehensive early warning system for poaching, illegal logging, and wildlife threats.

### 🔥 Key Features

- **📱 Multi-Channel Reporting**: SMS, USSD, Voice, and Mobile App integration
- **🤖 AI Threat Analysis**: Real-time threat prediction and risk assessment
- **🌙 Night Guard System**: 24/7 automated monitoring for remote areas
- **💰 Airtime Rewards**: Incentivize community participation
- **🛡️ Trust Network**: Community-driven verification system
- **📡 IoT Integration**: Camera traps, motion sensors, GPS collars
- **📊 Real-time Dashboard**: Live ranger operations center
- **🔔 Instant Alerts**: Emergency notification system
- **Slow & Reactive Response**: By the time threats are detected, damage is done. Patrols are often random, wasting resources
- **Low Community Engagement**: Local communities lack safe, easy channels to report incidents and receive feedback

## 💡 Solution

WildGuard provides:

✅ **Unified Reporting**: Community USSD/SMS/Voice reports, IoT sensors, and satellite data in one real-time map  
✅ **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered threat analysis to predict poaching and habitat risks  
✅ **Trust Network**: Crowd-based verification to reduce false alarms  
✅ **Instant Rewards**: Airtime incentives for verified contributions  
✅ **Mobile-First**: Works on any phone, even without internet via Africa's Talking APIs
